Serving a cache manifest requires that your server be setup to know what a manifest is. This is easily accomplished when using an Apache server by using an htaccess file. 

This folder already has an htaccess file in it, so you can copy the entire folder to a server. However, as system files are typically invisible, I've duplicated the file as a text file. If you prefer, simply upload the text file and then rename it, on the server, from "htaccess.txt" to ".htaccess"
